    line: 'I''m gonna fight ''em all

      A seven nation army couldn''t hold me
      back

      They''re gonna rip it off

      Taking their time right behind
      my back

      And I''m talking to myself at night

      Because I can''t
      forget

      Back and forth through my mind

      Behind a cigarette

      And
      the message coming from my eyes

      Says, "Leave it alone"

      Don''t
      wanna hear about it

      Every single one''s got a story to tell

      Everyone
      knows about it

      From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell

      And
      if I catch it coming back my way

      I''m gonna serve it to you

      And
      that ain''t what you want to hear

      But that''s what I''ll do

      And
      the feeling coming from my bones

      Says, "Find a home"

      I''m going
      to Wichita

      Far from this opera forevermore

      I''m gonna work
      the straw

      Make the sweat drip out of every pore

      And I''m bleeding,
      and I''m bleeding, and I''m bleeding

      Right before the Lord

      All
      the words are gonna bleed from me

      And I will sing no more

      And
      the stains coming from my blood

      Tell me, "Go back home"'
